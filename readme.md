# Trillium Web Solutions

This repo contains the files for a website that is a greatly modified project from the course
> The Complete 2020 Web Developer Bootcamp by Angela Yu

The Tillium Web Soutions project is a sample home page that might be used by a web developer
for promotional purposes. It uses HTML, CSS & JavaScript for it's functionality. User inputs
are validated prior to form submission. It was designed for desk-top & is not responsive to small screen sizes. As there is no database included, it is a front-end design only.

This repo contains my most recent version of this website.
